Unique additions:
1. The distance of the castles varies by levels.
2. There is a count of how many shots you are allowed to take.  If you exceed this count, it's game over.
3. The sound of the projectile going through the air is dependent on the velocity of the projectile.  As the projectile slows, the volume decreases, and vice versa.
4. There is a thwoop sound when you launch the projectile.
5. There is a short end game music clip to calm your nerves because this game is frustrating.
